evtcinfo
========

evtcinfo is a command line file preview tool to quickly scan `.evtc` files,
as generated by the [arcdps addon](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/)
for the Guild Wars 2 video game.

I use evtcinfo as a preview tool inside my file manager [vifm](https://github.com/vifm/vifm).
You can configure vifm to use evtcinfo for file preview
by adding this to your `~/.config/vifm/vifmrc`
```vifmrc
" arcdps logs
fileviewer {*.evtc,*.zevtc,*.evtc.zip} evtcinfo
```
